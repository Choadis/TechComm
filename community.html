            <p class="content"> The Lancaster tech community expects that activities, events, and digital forums: </p>
            <ul class="content">
              <li> 1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants. </li>
              <li> 2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities. </li>
              <li> 3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value. </li>
              <li> 4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions. </li>
              <li> 5. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak. </li>
              <li> 6. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. </li>
              <li> 7. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized. </li>
              <li> 8. Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups. </li>
              <li> 9. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
                <li> 10. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and participating organizations remain respectful, participatory, and productive. </li>
                <li> 11. Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment. </li>
              </ul>
